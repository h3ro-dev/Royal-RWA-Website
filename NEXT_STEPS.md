# Royal RWA - Immediate Next Steps

## 🚨 Priority 1: Project Initialization (Do First!)

Run these commands from the main branch:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create Next.js app structure
mkdir -p app/api
mkdir -p app/(routes)

# 3. Create environment file
echo "# Royal RWA Environment Variables" > .env.local

# 4. Initialize TypeScript config (if not exists)
npx tsc --init

# 5. Verify setup
npm run dev
```

## 👥 Priority 2: Engineer Kickoff

### Engineer 1 - Foundation (Start Immediately)
```bash
./engineer-tools.sh
# Select option 1

# First tasks:
1. Create design tokens in src/styles/tokens.ts
2. Build Button component in src/components/Button.tsx
3. Create base layout component
4. Update interfaces.json status to "in-progress"
```

### Engineer 2 - Features (Start After Dependencies Installed)
```bash
./engineer-tools.sh
# Select option 2

# First tasks:
1. Create app/page.tsx (homepage)
2. Set up routing structure
3. Build static hero section
4. Update interfaces.json with page status
```

### Engineer 3 - Data (Start Immediately)
```bash
./engineer-tools.sh
# Select option 3

# First tasks:
1. Create mock data in src/lib/mock-data.ts
2. Set up API routes in app/api/
3. Create data types in src/types/
4. Update interfaces.json with API endpoints
```

### Engineer 4 - Performance (Start Immediately)
```bash
./engineer-tools.sh
# Select option 4

# First tasks:
1. Set up Vitest config
2. Create test structure
3. Set up performance monitoring
4. Update interfaces.json with targets
```

## 🔄 Priority 3: First Integration Checkpoint (2 Hours)

After 2 hours, each engineer should:

1. **Commit their work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: [description of work done]"
   git push origin [your-branch]
   ```

2. **Update interfaces.json**
   - Change statuses from "planned" to "in-progress"
   - Add any new interfaces discovered

3. **Check integration**
   - GitHub Actions will run automatically
   - Check for any conflicts or issues

## 📊 Success Metrics for Day 1

By end of Day 1, we should have:

- [ ] Basic Next.js app running
- [ ] 5+ components created (Engineer 1)
- [ ] Homepage and 2+ routes created (Engineer 2)
- [ ] Mock data system complete (Engineer 3)
- [ ] Test framework configured (Engineer 4)
- [ ] All engineers have committed at least 4 times
- [ ] interfaces.json updated by all engineers

## 🚀 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Switch between branches
./engineer-tools.sh

# Check all branch statuses
git branch -a

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Check your changes
git status

# View interfaces.json status
cat interfaces.json | jq '.engineer1.components' # (change number for your engineer)
```

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Commit every 2 hours** - This is mandatory!
2. **Only edit your section** in interfaces.json
3. **Pull before starting** each work session
4. **Check GitHub Actions** for integration status
5. **Communicate through interfaces.json**, not Slack/Discord
