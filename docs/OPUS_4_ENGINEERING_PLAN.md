# Opus 4 Engineering Plan: AI-Native Parallel Development

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a revolutionary 4-engineer parallel development approach for the Royal RWA website, designed specifically for AI engineers (Claude Opus 4 instances) working at maximum capacity. By eliminating human constraints and leveraging AI's unique capabilities, we can build a production-ready platform in 4 days instead of 4 weeks.

## The 4-Engineer Architecture

### Engineer 1: Foundation Architect
**Domain**: Design System & Core Components
**Output**: Complete component library, responsive framework, styling system

### Engineer 2: Feature Builder  
**Domain**: Core Features & User Flows
**Output**: Calculator, token visualizer, staking interface, all user-facing features

### Engineer 3: Data Orchestrator
**Domain**: Backend, APIs, Web3 Integration
**Output**: Real-time data feeds, blockchain integration, API layer

### Engineer 4: Performance Guardian
**Domain**: Polish, Performance, Testing
**Output**: Animations, optimizations, test suite, production readiness

## Why 4 Engineers is Optimal

- **100% Utilization**: Each engineer owns a complete vertical slice
- **Zero Blocking**: Dependencies managed through interfaces, not implementations  
- **Perfect Parallel**: No coordination overhead or context switching
- **Domain Expertise**: Each engineer becomes a deep specialist instantly

More engineers would create coordination overhead. Fewer would create bottlenecks. Four is the sweet spot.

## Communication Protocol

### 1. Commit Frequency
- Every 2 hours, each engineer commits to their feature branch
- Detailed commit messages explaining changes
- No commits to other engineers' domains

### 2. Interface Contract (interfaces.json)
```json
{
  "engineer1": {
    "components": {
      "Button": {
        "props": "{ variant: 'primary' | 'secondary', size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' }",
        "usage": "<Button variant='primary' size='md'>Click</Button>"
      }
    }
  },
  "engineer2": {
    "features": {
      "calculator": {
        "input": "{ amount: number, period: string }",
        "output": "{ total: number, profit: number, apy: number }"
      }
    }
  },
  "engineer3": {
    "apis": {
      "GET /api/yields": {
        "response": "{ current: number, historical: number[] }"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Branch Strategy
```bash
main
├── feat/engineer1-design-system
├── feat/engineer2-features  
├── feat/engineer3-backend
└── feat/engineer4-performance
```

### 4. Integration Points
- Automated builds every 6 hours
- Immediate conflict resolution
- Continuous integration testing

## Folder Ownership

```
src/
├── components/        # Engineer 1
├── styles/           # Engineer 1
├── app/              # Engineer 2
│   ├── calculator/
│   ├── tokens/
│   └── staking/
├── lib/              # Engineer 3
│   ├── api/
│   ├── web3/
│   └── data/
├── tests/            # Engineer 4
├── config/           # Engineer 4
└── types/            # Shared (append-only)
```

## Quality Assurance Protocol

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run every 6 hours
- E2E tests run before daily merge
- Performance tests track metrics

### Code Standards
- ESLint + Prettier enforced
- TypeScript strict mode
- 100% type coverage
- Consistent naming conventions

### Review Process
- Each engineer reviews others' interfaces
- Engineer 4 performs integration review
- Automated checks for standards
- No human review needed (AI precision)

## Success Metrics

### Day 1 Success
✓ Design system functional  
✓ All routes created
✓ Mock data flowing
✓ Build pipeline working

### Day 2 Success

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Interface Misalignment**: Mitigated by interfaces.json
2. **Merge Conflicts**: Mitigated by domain separation
3. **Performance Regression**: Mitigated by continuous monitoring
4. **Scope Creep**: Mitigated by fixed timeline

### Contingency Plans
- If behind schedule: Reduce polish, maintain core features
- If conflicts arise: Engineer 4 has override authority
- If external dependencies fail: Use extended mocks
