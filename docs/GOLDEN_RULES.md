# Royal RWA Golden Rules - Never Forget These

## The 10 Commandments of Royal RWA

### 1. **The RWA Token Does NOT Generate Yield**
The ROYAL RWA TOKEN is a utility token for ecosystem access. Yield ONLY comes from staking. Never promise or imply direct yields from holding RWA tokens.

### 2. **Real Assets Are Our Foundation**
Every claim must tie back to real, verifiable assets:
- 25% Bitcoin
- 50% Real World Assets (Fisheries, Oil, Gold, etc.)
- 25% Cash/Sukuk

### 3. **100% Over-Collateralization is Sacred**
The ROYAL STABLECOIN is ALWAYS 100% over-collateralized. This is non-negotiable and must be prominently communicated.

### 4. **We Serve the Underserved**
Priority markets: Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, Ghana. Every design decision should consider users on 3G with $50 phones.

### 5. **Trust Through Transparency**
- Show real-time data
- Display audit reports
- Reveal team members
- Expose asset holdings
Never hide behind complexity.

### 6. **Education Before Profit**
We don't prey on ignorance. Educate users about:
- What tokenization means
- How yields are generated
- What risks exist
- Why this is different

### 7. **Mobile-First, Always**
90% of our African users will be on mobile. If it doesn't work perfectly on a phone, it doesn't ship.

### 8. **Respect Cultural Context**
- Sharia compliance matters
- Local success stories over global ones
- Language isn't just translation
- Images should reflect our users

### 9. **Premium but Accessible**
Look expensive, feel inclusive. Use:
- Deep midnight blue (#1a1a4e to #2d2d7f)
- Rich gold (#d4af37 to #ffd700)
- Modern effects with purpose
- Clean, sophisticated design

### 10. **Innovation Serves People**
Technology is the means, not the end. Every feature must answer: "How does this help someone protect and grow their wealth?"

## The Never List

### NEVER Say:
- "Guaranteed returns"
- "Risk-free investment"
- "Get rich quick"
- "Exclusive to the wealthy"
- "Complex financial instruments"

### NEVER Show:
- Fake testimonials
- Misleading charts
- Hidden fees
- Confusing interfaces
- Inaccessible content

### NEVER Forget:

- Trust is earned, not given
- Simplicity is sophisticated
- Our mission is empowerment

## The Always List

### ALWAYS Display:
- Current collateralization ratio
- Real-time asset values
- Clear fee structures
- Multiple contact methods
- Security certifications

### ALWAYS Consider:

## Quick Decision Framework

When in doubt, ask:
1. **Does this build trust?**
2. **Can someone in rural Kenya use this?**
3. **Is this backed by real assets?**
4. **Are we being transparent?**
5. **Does this empower users?**

If any answer is "No" - stop and reconsider.

## The Royal Promise

We promise to:
- **Protect** wealth from inflation
- **Provide** access to quality investments  
- **Prove** everything with transparency
- **Profit** together with our community
- **Progress** toward financial inclusion

## Remember the Mission

"We're not just building a platform. We're building a bridge between two worlds - where sovereign wealth meets individual opportunity, where sophisticated finance meets simple access, where the future of money meets the people who need it most."
