Your GitHub Repository Information
==================================

Repository is SUCCESSFULLY on GitHub! âœ…

GitHub URL: https://github.com/CryptoJym/Royal-RWA-Website
Clone Command: git clone https://github.com/CryptoJym/Royal-RWA-Website.git
Owner: CryptoJym
Repository Name: Royal-RWA-Website
Current Branch: main
Local Folder: /Users/jamesbrady/Royal Website

If the background agent still says it can't find your repository, try these:

1. RESTART the background agent (close and reopen it)

2. Tell the agent to look here:
   - GitHub URL: https://github.com/CryptoJym/Royal-RWA-Website
   - Or username: CryptoJym
   - Repository name: Royal-RWA-Website

3. If the agent has a "Add Repository" or "Import" button:
   - Click it and paste: https://github.com/CryptoJym/Royal-RWA-Website

4. The space in "Royal Website" folder name might confuse some tools.
   If needed, you could rename the folder to "Royal-Website" (no space).

Your repository is 100% on GitHub and working correctly!
The issue is with the background agent not refreshing, not with your setup.
