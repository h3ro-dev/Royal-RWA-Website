# Royal RWA Website Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Vision
Build a revolutionary financial platform website that bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology, making institutional-grade yields from real-world assets accessible to global investors.

## 🌍 Critical Understanding

- **Investors Located In**: Global wealth centers (UAE, Singapore, UK, US, Switzerland, etc.)

## 💎 The Three-Token Ecosystem

### 1. ROYAL RWA TOKEN
- **Purpose**: Utility token for ecosystem access
- **Supply**: 50 billion (90% for capital raising)
- **Critical**: Does NOT generate yield directly - must be staked

### 2. ROYAL LP TOKEN  
- **Purpose**: Rewards for staking RWA tokens
- **Yields**: 10% (flexible), 12% (1-year), 14% (2-year)
- **Mechanism**: Distributed based on staking commitment

### 3. ROYAL STABLECOIN
- **Purpose**: Stable medium of exchange
- **Backing**: 100% over-collateralized by RWAs and gold
- **Use Case**: Remittances, savings, transactions
